# DigiSparkBadUSB
Payloads for Digispark Default 16.5MHz

If you encounter any issues with the payloads please select "Micronucleus" programmer to flash the digispark.
Only use the payloads on default 16.5MHz original digispark devices.
Functionality not tested with USBTinyISP programmer, but may work.

Before using the payloads, please check if your USB serial numbers match the ones in the payloads. Some el-cheapo china USB devices lack a serial number or may change them during the process due to driver issues.
